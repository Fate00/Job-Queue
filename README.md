The application was implemented using AngularJS and Node.js. Using Bootstrap to create UI.

The application contains two pages, one is for submitting jobs and check job status, the other is for changing job status. 

The data is simply stored in a global variable. The application doesn't use database. So everytime restart the server, the original record will lose.
